FIFO stands for "First In, First Out," and it refers to a type of memory organization in which the data that is written into the memory first is also the data that is read out first. In other words, the data items that are added to the memory are stored in a queue-like structure, and the first data item to be added to the queue is also the first one to be retrieved.

FIFO memory is commonly used in computer systems to manage data streams that arrive in a continuous flow. For example, a printer buffer may use a FIFO memory to store print jobs as they arrive. Each new print job is added to the end of the queue, and the printer reads the jobs from the beginning of the queue and prints them in the order they were received.

FIFO memory can also be used in other applications where data needs to be processed in a specific order, such as in digital signal processing, real-time data acquisition, and network packet processing.
